# Requirement Analysis in Software Development


## Introduction
This repository is created to demonstrate the understanding of **Requirement Analysis** as part of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It explains what requirement analysis is, why it’s important, the key activities involved, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria.  
The content here focuses on applying these concepts to a **Booking Management System Project** similar to platforms like Airbnb. This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding how software requirements are identified, analyzed, and validated before development begins.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs or conditions that a system must fulfill to solve a particular problem or achieve specific goals. It serves as the foundation for software development, ensuring that the project team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the software is supposed to do.  

During Requirement Analysis, business goals, user needs, and technical constraints are carefully studied to create clear, actionable, and testable software requirements.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the software being built aligns with user expectations and business goals.  

Here are three key reasons why it’s important:
1. **Prevents Miscommunication:** Clearly defined requirements help ensure that developers, clients, and stakeholders share the same understanding of the project goals.  
2. **Saves Time and Cost:** Early identification and correction of unclear or incomplete requirements prevent costly rework later in the project.  
3. **Improves Quality:** Well-documented and validated requirements form the basis for testing, ensuring that the final product meets user needs effectively.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Below are the five key activities typically performed during Requirement Analysis:

- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting information from stakeholders, users, and documents to understand the project’s needs and objectives.  
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Conducting interviews, surveys, brainstorming sessions, or workshops to extract detailed and specific requirements from stakeholders.  
- **Requirement Documentation:** Writing down the collected requirements in a structured format, such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyzing the gathered data to identify inconsistencies, dependencies, and priorities. Creating models or diagrams (like use case diagrams) to visualize system behavior.  
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring that the documented requirements are complete, consistent, and in alignment with business objectives before development begins.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements describe **what the system should do** — the specific behaviors, tasks, and functions it must perform.  

**Examples (for the Booking Management System):**  
- Users should be able to search for available properties by location and date.  
- The system should allow users to create an account and log in.  
- Users should be able to make, edit, and cancel bookings.  
- The system should send booking confirmation emails to users.  

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional Requirements define **how the system performs** rather than what it does. These include performance, usability, security, and scalability aspects.  

**Examples (for the Booking Management System):**  
- The website should load within 3 seconds on standard internet connections.  
- The system should handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.  
- User data should be encrypted to ensure privacy and security.  
- The application should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between **actors** (users or external systems) and the **system** itself. They help identify system functionalities and clarify user roles, making them a valuable tool during Requirement Analysis.

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**
- Provide a high-level overview of the system’s functionality.  
- Help communicate requirements between technical and non-technical stakeholders.  
- Simplify system design by defining user-system interactions clearly.  

**Use Case Diagram for the Booking System:**  
Below is the diagram illustrating key use cases such as searching properties, viewing details, making bookings, and checking out.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the specific conditions under which a software feature is considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They act as checkpoints to verify that each feature meets user expectations and business goals.

**Importance of Acceptance Criteria:**
- Ensure clarity on what constitutes a “done” feature.  
- Help align developer output with stakeholder expectations.  
- Provide measurable goals for testing and validation.

**Example (Checkout Feature):**
- Users must be able to review their booking summary before payment.  
- Payment information should be securely processed using SSL encryption.  
- The system should send a booking confirmation email within 2 minutes of successful payment.  
- The checkout process should not take more than 3 steps.
